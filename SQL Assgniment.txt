'Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.'
'A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically 
from a computer system. Databases are designed to manage, store, and retrieve large amounts of information easily.'

SQL Databases:

Structure: Relational databases with a predefined schema (table structure).
Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language).
Scalability: Vertical scaling (adding more power to an existing machine).
Transactions: Support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.


NoSQL Databases:

Structure: Non-relational, often schema-less; can store data in various forms like key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs.
Query Language: Various, depending on the type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries).
Scalability: Horizontal scaling (adding more machines to the pool).
Transactions: Often support eventual consistency, though some can support ACID.
Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.







Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.

DDL (Data Definition Language) includes SQL commands used to define the database structure or schema.

CREATE: Used to create a new table, database, index, or view.
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Position VARCHAR(100)
);


DROP: Used to delete objects like tables, databases, or views
DROP TABLE Employees;


ALTER: Used to modify an existing database object, like adding or removing columns from a table.
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);


TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, but the table structure remains.
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;






Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.
DML (Data Manipulation Language) includes SQL commands used to manipulate data stored in the database.

INSERT: Adds new rows to a table.
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Position) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Developer');


UPDATE: Modifies existing rows in a table
UPDATE Employees SET Position = 'Senior Developer' WHERE ID = 1;


DELETE: Removes existing rows from a table.
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;






Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.
DQL (Data Query Language) is used to query the database and retrieve data.

SELECT: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
SELECT Name, Position FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;






Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.

Primary Key: A column (or combination of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. Each table can have only one primary key, and it cannot contain NULL values.
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);


Foreign Key: A column (or combination of columns) that establishes a link between data in two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table, ensuring referential integrity.
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(ID)
);






Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.

'import mysql.connector

# Establish the connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employees")

# Fetch and print the results
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()'

cursor(): Creates a cursor object which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch data from the database.
execute(query): Executes the SQL query passed to it.






Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
The order of execution of SQL clauses is as follows:

FROM (including JOINs)
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
DISTINCT
ORDER BY
LIMIT (or TOP, depending on the SQL dialect)
This order ensures that SQL queries are processed logically, starting with the source data, filtering, grouping, and finally projecting the desired columns.
