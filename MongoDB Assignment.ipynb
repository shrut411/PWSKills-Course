    "MongoDB:\n",
    "MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data, providing high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not use the traditional table-based relational model. Instead, they can use document, key-value, wide-column, or graph formats. These databases are designed for specific data models and have flexible schemas, making them suitable for storing unstructured data.\n",

    "Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB over SQL Databases:\n",

    "Unstructured Data: When dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data where the schema can change over time.\n",
    "Scalability: Applications requiring horizontal scalability to handle large volumes of data and high throughput.\n",

    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for a flexible data model, where each document can have a different structure.\n",
    "Document-Oriented Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), which allows for rich, hierarchical structures within documents.\n",
    "High Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized for read and write operations, making it suitable for high-transaction applications.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large data volumes.\n",
    "Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides high availability and redundancy through replica sets, which replicate data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports various indexing techniques to optimize query performance, including single field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful framework for data aggregation, enabling complex data processing and transformation operations.\n",
    "Load Balancing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatically distributes data and traffic, providing load balancing across servers.\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports dynamic querying, allowing users to create queries on the fly.\n",
    "GridFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "A specification for storing and retrieving large files, such as images and videos, in MongoDB.\"\"\""
