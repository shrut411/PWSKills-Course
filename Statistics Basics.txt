Q1. What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps in decision-making and finding trends or patterns in data.

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.

1. Descriptive Statistics – Summarizes data (e.g., mean, median, mode, charts).
   Example: Calculating the average test score of students in a class.
2. Inferential Statistics – Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.
   Example: Predicting election results based on a survey of 1,000 voters.

Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example.

1. Qualitative (Categorical): Non-numeric, describes characteristics (e.g., gender, color).
   Example: Eye color – brown, blue, green.
2. Quantitative (Numerical): Numeric data (e.g., age, height).
   Example: Age – 21, 35, 40.

Q4. Categorise the datasets as quantitative or qualitative:
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E → Qualitative (Ordinal)
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red → Qualitative (Nominal)
(iii) Height data of a class: \[178.9, 179, ...] → Quantitative (Continuous)
(iv) Number of mangoes exported: \[500, 600, 478, ...] → Quantitative (Discrete)

Q5. Explain levels of measurement and example of variable for each:

1. Nominal – Names/labels (e.g., Gender: Male/Female)
2. Ordinal – Order matters, but not exact difference (e.g., Satisfaction: High, Medium, Low)
3. Interval – Ordered with equal intervals, but no true zero (e.g., Temperature in Celsius)
4. Ratio – Like interval, but has true zero (e.g., Weight, Height)

Q6. Why is understanding level of measurement important?
Because it determines the type of statistical tests and visualizations that are valid.
Example: You cannot compute the mean of a nominal variable like "Eye Color".

Q7. How nominal data is different from ordinal data?
Nominal: No order (e.g., Colors: Red, Blue)
Ordinal: Has order but no fixed difference (e.g., Class Rank: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Q8. Which plot can display data in terms of range?
Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot) – Shows minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.

Q9. Difference between descriptive and inferential statistics:
Descriptive: Describes/summarizes data (e.g., average score of class)
Inferential: Makes predictions from data (e.g., predicting population behavior from a sample)

Q10. Measures of central tendency and variability:
Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode – represent typical value.
Variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation – show how spread out data is.
Example: A small standard deviation means data is closely clustered around the mean.
