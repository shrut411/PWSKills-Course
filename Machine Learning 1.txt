**Q1: Explain the following with an example:**

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Example: Siri or Alexa, which can understand and respond to voice commands.
2. **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where machines learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Example: Email spam filters that learn to identify spam based on previous emails.
3. **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. Example: Facial recognition systems like those in smartphones.

**Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.**
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns the mapping between input and output.
Examples:

* Image classification (e.g., identifying cats vs dogs)
* Spam email detection
* Predicting house prices

**Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.**
Unsupervised learning is where the model is given unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships within it.
Examples:

* Customer segmentation
* Market basket analysis
* Anomaly detection

**Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?**

* **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Broad field involving machines that mimic human intelligence.
* **ML (Machine Learning):** Subfield of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.
* **DL (Deep Learning):** Subset of ML using neural networks with many layers.
* **DS (Data Science):** Involves extracting insights from data using techniques from ML, statistics, and domain knowledge.

**Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?**

* **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data; clear input-output mapping.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data; finds hidden patterns.
* **Semi-supervised Learning:** Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data; combines the advantages of both methods.

**Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.**

* **Train Set:** Used to train the model.
* **Validation Set:** Used to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting.
* **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the final modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.
  Importance: Ensures the model generalizes well to new data and is not just memorizing the training data.

**Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?**
Unsupervised learning can identify anomalies by recognizing patterns in data and flagging data points that do not fit these patterns. For example, detecting fraudulent transactions in banking systems.

**Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.**

* **Supervised Learning Algorithms:**

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Random Forest
  * Neural Networks

* **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:**

  * K-Means Clustering
  * Hierarchical Clustering
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Autoencoders
