Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?

The three measures of central tendency are mean (average), median (middle value when ordered), and mode (most frequent value).

Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?

Mean: Sum of all values divided by the number of values; it represents the average.
Median: Middle value when data is ordered; it splits the dataset into two equal halves.
Mode: Most frequent value; it shows the most common value.
They measure central tendency by summarizing the dataset’s center in different ways: mean is sensitive to all values, median is robust to outliers, and mode highlights frequency.
Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]

Data: [172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176.2, 176.5, 177, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180] (sorted).

Mean: Sum = 2845.3, count = 16, so mean = 2845.3 / 16 = 177.83125 ≈ 177.83.
Median: Middle values (8th and 9th) are 177 and 177, so median = (177 + 177) / 2 = 177.
Mode: 178 appears 4 times, the most frequent, so mode = 178.
Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]

Mean = 177.83 (from Q3).
Variance:
Differences from mean: (178-177.83)², (177-177.83)², ..., (176.5-177.83)².
Values: 0.0289, 0.6889, 3.3489, 0.6889, 0.1344, 0.0289, 7.7289, 1.3689, 4.7089, 7.7289, 1.1449, 2.5289, 0.6889, 28.4089, 0.0289, 1.8489.
Sum of squares = 61.035, variance = 61.035 / 16 = 3.8146875.
Standard deviation = √3.8146875 ≈ 1.953.
Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.

Range: Difference between max and min; shows total spread.
Variance: Average of squared deviations from the mean; measures spread around the mean.
Standard deviation: Square root of variance; indicates typical deviation from the mean.
Example: Dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Range = 5 - 1 = 4, mean = 3, variance = [(1-3)² + (2-3)² + ... + (5-3)²] / 5 = 2, standard deviation = √2 ≈ 1.41.
Q6. What is a Venn diagram?

A Venn diagram is a visual representation of sets using overlapping circles to show relationships like union, intersection, and differences between sets.

Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10), find:

(i) A ∩ B: Intersection (common elements) = {2, 6}.
(ii) A ∪ B: Union (all elements) = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}.
Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?

Skewness describes the asymmetry of a dataset’s distribution. Positive (right) skew has a longer right tail (e.g., income distributions), negative (left) skew has a longer left tail (e.g., age at death), and zero skew is symmetric (e.g., normal distribution).

Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?

In right-skewed data, the mean is greater than the median because the mean is pulled toward the longer right tail.

Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?

Covariance: Measures how two variables vary together; positive if they increase together, negative if one increases as the other decreases.
Correlation: Standardized covariance (between -1 and 1); measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship.
In statistical analysis, covariance identifies the direction of the relationship, while correlation quantifies its strength and is used to assess linear dependency.
Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.

Formula: Sample mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values).

Example: Dataset [4, 8, 6, 5]. Sum = 23, count = 4, mean = 23 / 4 = 5.75.

Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?

In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal and located at the center of the symmetric bell curve.

Q13. How do covariance and correlation differ from dispersion?

Covariance and correlation measure the relationship between two variables (direction and strength, respectively), while dispersion (e.g., variance, standard deviation) measures the spread of a single variable around its mean.

Q14. How do outliers affect the measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.

Outliers heavily affect the mean (pulls it toward the outlier) and dispersion measures like range and standard deviation (increases them), but the median is more robust.

Example: Dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. Mean = 22, median = 3, range = 99, standard deviation ≈ 43.7. Without 100, mean = 2.5, median = 2.5, range = 3, standard deviation ≈ 1.3.
